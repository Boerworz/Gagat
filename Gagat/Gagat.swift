	///         unless the returned handle has been deallocated.
	///
	/// - parameter window: The window that the user will pan in to trigger the
	///             transition.
	/// - parameter styleableObject: An object that conforms to `GagatStyleable` and
	///             which is responsible for toggling to the alternative style when
	///             the transition is triggered or cancelled.
	/// - parameter configuration: The configuration to use for the transition.
	///
	/// - returns: A new instance of `TransitionHandle`.
