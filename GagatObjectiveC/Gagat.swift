	///              any of its properties.
	///              All Gagat-related objects will be torn down when the
	///              handle is deallocated, and the client will need to call
	///              `-[GGTManager configureForWindow:withStyleableObject:usingConfiguration:]`
	///              again to re-enable the Gagat transition.
	///
	/// - note: This method shouldn't be called multiple times for the same window
	///         unless the returned handle has been deallocated.
	///
	/// - parameter window: The window that the user will pan in to trigger the
	///             transition.
	/// - parameter styleableObject: An object that conforms to `GGTStyleable` and
	///             which is responsible for toggling to the alternative style when
	///             the transition is triggered or cancelled.
	/// - parameter configuration: The configuration to use for the transition.
	///
	/// - returns: A new instance of `GGTTransitionHandle`.
